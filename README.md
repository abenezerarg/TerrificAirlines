# TerrificAirlines
Terrific Airlines is a user interface for built using C++ code by Abenezer Argaw, Nahum Tariku, & Jiabin Lin for a University of Colorado Boulder Data Structures course. 

## What is Terrific Airlines?
It is a terminal based user interface that allows possible customers to book, cancel, and check on specific flight confirmations. To accomplish this we used two main data structures, graphs and priority queues. We used a min heap as our priority queue. The priority queue uses traveling classes to decide the boarding of the plane and therefore the seating chart of the plane. If the classes are the same then we use a first come first serve method where the first person added into the queue gets to board earlier and therefore have a seat close to the front of the plane. So while our priority queue represented the passenger list of a flights, our graph structure was used as the actual cities that passenger would fly from and the edges connecting the cities represents the actual flight available. The vertices included the name of the city, along with visited node for traversal (which was used to debug) and finally a vector of edges that the city could fly to. The Edges included two weights: the distance from one city to another, and the duration of the flight. Additionally, the edge included three priority queue, divided by the three flight classes provided: First Class, Business Class, and Economy Class.
